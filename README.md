## Messenger TODO BOT

A Minimalist Todo Tool that runs on Facebook messenger. It can help you manage your todo list and remind you of your todos through messaging.

You can start managing your todo through the link:

> Messenger Link: [m.me/104448737749304](https://m.me/104448737749304)

It works like a personal assistant that you can tell when should it remind you a todo by sending you a message as reminder. Also, you can simply set a daily reminder that allows it to send you a message containing all your todos everyday at a time you set.
